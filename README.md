# Angular2 Auth Starter ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/unicodeveloper-approved-brightgreen.svg) 

If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework, pick a CSS framework. A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as *Sign in with Facebook* authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.

Even if you are not using this for a hackathon, Angular 2 Auth Starter is sure to save any developer hours or even days of development time and can serve as a learning guide for web developers.

Angular 2 is a modern web application platform for building web and mobile applications.
